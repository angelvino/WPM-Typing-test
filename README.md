# WPM-Typing-test
Developed an interactive Speed Typing Test application using Python and the Curses library to enhance console-based user interfaces

## Technologies Used: Python, Curses Library

## Description:
Developed an interactive Speed Typing Test application using Python and the Curses library to enhance console-based user interfaces. The application features a dynamic and engaging typing test environment with the following functionalities:

** User Interface: Implemented a text-based UI with real-time feedback, including WPM (Words Per Minute) and typing accuracy.
** Dynamic Content: Loads random text samples for each test to ensure varied typing practice.
** Visual Feedback: Utilized color-coding to differentiate between correct, incorrect, and current characters, enhancing the user's focus and learning experience.
** Countdown Timer: Added a countdown timer to build anticipation and prepare users before the test begins.
** Real-Time Statistics: Continuously calculates and displays WPM and accuracy during typing.
** Completion Notification: Notifies users upon completion of the text with options to retry or exit the application.

## Key Features:

** Real-time display of typing speed and accuracy.
** Enhanced visual feedback with color differentiation for better user engagement.
** Smooth and responsive typing experience with error handling for backspace and special keys.
** User-friendly start screen and completion messages to guide the user through the process.

## Impact:

** Improved user engagement and learning by providing immediate visual and statistical feedback.
** Fostered better typing skills through randomized text inputs and real-time error correction.
